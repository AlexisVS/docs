## Key Features

### üîÑ **Entity-Event Architecture**
Every business operation is modeled as entities with standardized patterns for creation, modification, and relationship management. Events flow through the system to maintain consistency and enable reactive updates.

### üéØ **Type-Safe Development**
End-to-end type safety from Laravel backend to React frontend. Auto-generated TypeScript definitions ensure API contracts are always in sync with implementation.

### üåç **Multi-Language Ready**
Built-in internationalization with entity-aware translations. Support for French, English, and Dutch with easy extensibility for additional languages.

### üß™ **Test-Driven Development**
Comprehensive testing strategy with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing. No mocks - prefer feature tests with real database interactions.

## Development Philosophy

<Note>
    **Laravel-Confident Development**: We embrace framework coupling where it makes sense, following a pragmatic
    approach that balances clean architecture with developer productivity.
</Note>

<Warning>
    **Current Phase**: Focus on building resilient services. Future iterations will refactor toward Laravel-native
    solutions (Eloquent chains, helpers, facades) for reduced complexity.
</Warning>
